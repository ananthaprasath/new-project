          <p className="mb-0">
         A construction contract agreement is a formal document that outlines the <strong>scope, terms, and conditions</strong> of work for a construction project. 
      It is entered into between a <strong>contractor</strong> (who carries out the work) and the <strong>client</strong> (individual or company) hiring them. 
      This agreement ensures clarity and accountability for both parties throughout the construction process.</p>
