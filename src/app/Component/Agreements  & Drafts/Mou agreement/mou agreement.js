            A <strong>Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)</strong> is a formal document that outlines an agreement between two or more parties. It is often the first step toward creating a legally binding contract, but the MoU itself is <strong>not legally enforceable</strong>.
            While it does not create legal obligations, an MoU shows a mutual intention to move forward with a formal agreement and clearly documents each party’s expectations, goals, and responsibilities in the collaboration.</p>

            <p className="mb-4">
        A <strong>Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)</strong> is a formal document that outlines an agreement between two or more parties. It is often the first step toward a legally binding contract, but the MoU itself is <strong>not legally enforceable</strong>.
    An MoU is an expression of agreement to proceed. It indicates that the parties have reached a mutual understanding and are moving forward. Although not legally binding, it is a serious declaration that a contract is imminent.
     MoUs help clarify goals, roles, and expectations at an early stage of negotiation, and are especially useful in partnerships, joint ventures, and collaborations.

            <h4 className="text-center fw-bold mb-4">Contract vs. Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)</h4>
            <p className="mb-4">
        A <strong>contract</strong> is a legally enforceable agreement between two or more parties that creates an obligation to do (or not do) something. Contracts are binding under law and typically include detailed terms, conditions, and remedies in case of breach.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        A <strong>Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)</strong> is also an agreement between two or more parties, but unlike a contract, an MoU <strong>does not need to contain legally enforceable promises</strong>. It is often used as a formal gesture to outline a mutual understanding before a formal contract is signed.
      </p>
      <p>
        While contracts are used when parties are ready to be legally bound, MoUs are useful during early negotiations when parties want to express commitment without legal consequences.
