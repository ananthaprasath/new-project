            <p className="mb-0">
            A Vendor Contract, also known as a Vendor Agreement, is a legally binding business contract between two parties that governs the exchange of goods or services for payment. This agreement defines the scope of work, pricing, timelines, quality standards, and delivery terms, while also detailing each party’s roles and responsibilities. It helps protect both the vendor and the client by setting expectations, mitigating risks, and ensuring compliance with agreed-upon terms. Vendor contracts are essential for maintaining transparency and accountability in business transactions and are commonly used in sectors such as IT, manufacturing, logistics, event management, and retail.
