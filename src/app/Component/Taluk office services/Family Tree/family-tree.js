    What is a Family Tree in Land Ownership?
  </h2>

  <div className="khata-body">
    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
      A <strong>Family Tree</strong> is a legal document that lists the legal heirs of a deceased person. It is essential for determining rightful property ownership when the original landholder has passed away.
    </p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300">
      In Karnataka, the Family Tree is issued by the Village Accountant or Revenue Department. It includes names, relationships, and personal details of all legal heirs of the deceased, helping in smooth property transfer and mutation in revenue records.
    </p>

    <blockquote className="khata-quote" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400">
      “Without an approved Family Tree, mutation and property transfer cannot be legally completed.”
    </blockquote>

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="500">
      The Family Tree is commonly required in cases of inheritance, property partition, and to resolve ownership disputes. It becomes a foundational document to prove succession.
    </p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">
      You can apply for a certified Family Tree at the <strong>Taluk Office</strong> or through the <a href="https://nadakacheri.karnataka.gov.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nadakacheri portal</a>. Required documents typically include the death certificate, Aadhaar of heirs, and property details.

    Importance of Family Tree Document in Property Ownership
  </h2>

  <div className="khata-body">
    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
      A Family Tree, also called a Genealogy Certificate, is a document that maps the ancestral lineage of a person. It outlines the names, relationships, and order of succession within a family—typically used to identify legal heirs in the case of property inheritance.
    </p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300">
      While not legally binding by itself, a notarized Family Tree helps revenue officers, courts, and banks establish rightful ownership—especially when there is no registered will. It is frequently used in land mutation, partition deeds, and legal heir claims.
    </p>

    <blockquote className="khata-quote" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400">
      “A Family Tree bridges the gap between tradition and documentation — turning family history into legal clarity.”
    </blockquote>

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="500">
      In Karnataka, you can prepare a Family Tree by consulting with a local notary or advocate. The document typically lists names of parents, spouse, children, siblings, and sometimes extended relations — structured in a generational format. It should be signed and attested with supporting documents like Aadhaar, death certificates, or ration card.
    </p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">
      For formal recognition in revenue matters, it is advised to get the Family Tree verified by the Village Accountant or the Revenue Inspector. Some taluk offices or <a href="https://nadakacheri.karnataka.gov.in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nadakacheri portal</a> may require a family member's affidavit to validate the accuracy of claims.
    </p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="700">
      This document becomes especially useful in legal disputes, land sharing among siblings, succession applications, and while applying for a Legal Heir Certificate. It offers clarity and prevents future ownership conflicts.
