      question: "What is land conversion in Karnataka?",
      answer:
        "Land conversion is the legal process of changing land use from agricultural to non-agricultural purposes such as residential, commercial, or industrial. It is mandatory before constructing buildings on agricultural land.",
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      question: "Why do I need to convert agricultural land?",
      answer:
        "Without conversion, you cannot legally construct buildings or obtain water, electricity, or bank loans for housing or commercial use. Conversion gives legal permission for non-agricultural use.",
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      question: "Where do I apply for land conversion in Karnataka?",
      answer:
        "You can apply at the office of the Deputy Commissioner (DC) of your district or submit your request online via the official Bhoomi portal: https://landrecords.karnataka.gov.in/",
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      question: "What documents are needed for land conversion?",
      answer:
        "Required documents include RTC (Pahani), Mutation Record, Survey Sketch, NOC from relevant authorities (if needed), land tax receipt, and details of proposed land use.",
    },
    {
      id: 5,
      question: "How long does the conversion process take?",
      answer:
        "Typically, the process takes 30â€“60 days depending on document verification, field inspection, and DC office processing time. Delays may occur if reports are pending or objections arise.",
    },
    {
      id: 6,
      question: "Is there a fee for land conversion?",
      answer:
        "Yes. A conversion fee is charged based on the area and current guidance value of the land. It is usually calculated per square meter or per acre and varies by location.",
    },
    {
      id: 7,
      question: "Can I convert only part of my agricultural land?",
      answer:
        "Yes. You can apply for conversion of a specific portion of land. The survey sketch must clearly mark the area to be converted and retained as agricultural.",
    },
    {
      id: 8,
      question: "Is land conversion permanent?",
      answer:
        "Yes, once converted and approved by the DC office, the land use remains non-agricultural unless changed again through legal means. The Khata will also reflect the new land use.",
    },
