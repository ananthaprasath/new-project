    What is Layout Approval?
  </h2>

  <div className="khata-body">
    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
      Layout Approval is the official sanction given by a planning authority like BDA, BMRDA, DTCP, or Panchayat for converting agricultural land into a residential or commercial layout. This process ensures that the land development meets legal norms, infrastructure guidelines, and safety standards.
    </p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300">
      Approved layouts have designated roads, drainage systems, open spaces, and provision for civic amenities. Without proper layout approval, the site may be considered unauthorized, which can lead to legal issues or demolition.
    </p>

    <blockquote className="khata-quote" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400">
      “Always verify the layout approval number before buying any plot—legal plots are safer and easier to resell.”
    </blockquote>

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="500">
      Banks and financial institutions provide loans only for approved layouts. Such projects also fetch higher resale value and ensure peace of mind with clear documentation.
    </p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">
      In Karnataka, authorities like BMRDA (for Bangalore outskirts), BDA (for Bangalore city), and DTCP (for towns) review documents like the title deed, conversion certificate, layout map, and road plans before granting approval. Always ask for a copy of the approval document while purchasing.

      Layout Approval – Why It Matters in Land Purchase
    </h2>

    <div className="doc-body mt-4">
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">
        <strong>Layout Approval</strong> is the official sanction granted by urban or rural planning authorities like BDA, BMRDA, DTCP, or Panchayat. It permits the conversion of agricultural land into a plotted layout for residential or commercial use, ensuring adherence to zoning rules, road width standards, and utility planning.
      </p>

      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
        Approved layouts include properly marked roads, drainage lines, water sources, electricity access, and designated parks or open spaces. Buying a plot in an unapproved layout can lead to denial of building permissions, legal disputes, or even demolition notices.
      </p>
