    question: "What is a Mutation Register?",

      "The Mutation Register is a government record that tracks the transfer of ownership of land or property. It is updated when ownership changes due to sale, inheritance, gift, or court order.",

    id: 2,
    question: "Why is mutation necessary after property registration?",
    answer:

    id: 5,
    question: "Is it mandatory to mutate property before selling?",
