    What is 11E Sketch?
  </h2>

  <div className="khata-body">
    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
      The <strong>11E Sketch</strong> is an official land survey map issued by the Revenue Department of Karnataka. It marks the exact boundaries and subdivisions of a land parcel, especially when the land is being split among co-owners, for layout approval, or after inheritance.
    </p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300">
      This sketch clearly shows measurements, survey numbers, and road access for each portion. It is prepared and signed by the Assistant Director of Land Records (ADLR) after a physical survey of the land.
    </p>

    <blockquote className="khata-quote" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400">
      “An 11E Sketch is like a legal blueprint for your land – officially accepted and mapped for government records.”
    </blockquote>

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="500">
      It plays a crucial role in layout approval, mutation, khata transfer, and property registration. Having an 11E Sketch helps avoid boundary disputes and makes legal documentation smoother for every subdivided plot.
    </p>

      Why is 11E Sketch Important?
    </h3>
    <ul data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="700">
      <li>Defines clear land boundaries and measurements</li>
      <li>Helps during layout approvals and land conversion</li>

    Complete Guide to 11E Sketch in Karnataka Land Records
  </h2>

  <div className="khata-body">
    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
      The <strong>11E Sketch</strong> is an official land demarcation document issued by the Karnataka Revenue Department. It is prepared when a single survey number needs to be divided into smaller plots due to partition, inheritance, layout development, or resale. This sketch provides legal shape and dimension to each subdivided portion of land.
    </p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300">
      Every 11E Sketch is drawn to scale by an authorized government surveyor after a physical field inspection. It clearly outlines boundaries, plot measurements, survey numbers, and road access, ensuring there is no overlap or ambiguity in land ownership across the subdivided plots.
    </p>

    <blockquote className="khata-quote" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400">
      “An 11E Sketch turns a general landholding into well-defined legal plots — essential for mutation, registration, and layout planning.”
    </blockquote>

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="500">
      This sketch is mandatory while applying for layout approvals from authorities like BDA, BMRDA, or DTCP. It also serves as a key document during Khata bifurcation, mutation updates, and legal property transfers. Without it, individual ownership claims on a divided property may be considered invalid or incomplete by local authorities.
    </p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">
      To initiate the 11E Sketch process, landowners must submit an application to the Taluk Survey Office along with:
    </p>

    <ul data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="650">
      <li>Copy of RTC (Pahani) or Record of Rights</li>
      <li>Registered Sale Deed or Partition Deed</li>
      <li>Aadhar or valid ID proof</li>
      <li>Sketch Request Application (Form-11E)</li>
    </ul>

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="700">
      Once submitted, a licensed surveyor visits the site, performs GPS-based measurements, and submits the draft sketch to the Assistant Director of Land Records (ADLR) for verification. After approval, the final 11E Sketch is digitally signed and uploaded to the Bhoomi portal or delivered as a certified copy.
    </p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="750">
      The 11E Sketch is widely accepted by banks, registration offices, and planning bodies. It not only prevents future boundary disputes but also simplifies the process of converting agricultural land to non-agricultural use.
